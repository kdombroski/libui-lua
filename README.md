# libui-lua
Simple Lua binding to libui library.

Compatable with Lua >= 5.1

Depends on changes to libui library that are not in the upstream repository.
You should therefore you should use libui from https://github.com/mdombroski/libui.

This unfortunately excludes mac compatability. I don't own a mac, don't intend to, and I don't know objective-C.
